## About The Project

This project emerged from the need for a reliable and efficient way to interface with the TON Network, managing balances, payments, and transactions of TON coins and TGR tokens. It provides a user-friendly PHP interface for setting up wallet creation, balance checking, payment sending, and viewing transaction statistics.

## Built With

The project comprises a docker container developed in .JS, which interfaces with the TON network's jsonRPC. The user interface is built using PHP for ease of use and accessibility.

## Getting Started

Ensure your docker version is up to date:
```sh
docker -v
```
Example output:
Docker version 23.0.6, build ef23cbc

## Prerequisites

Docker installed on the server.
Open the necessary port in iptables, e.g., 5885.

## Installation
1. Obtain an API Key from http://toncenter.com/api or set up your own ton-http API.

2. Set up the ton-server:

- Upload ton-server to your server.
- Navigate to the ton-server folder:

Go to the ton-server folder:
```sh
cd ton-server
```
Build and run docker:
```sh
docker build -t ton-server .
```
```sh
docker run -d -p 127.0.0.1:5881:80 ton-server
```

3. Install ton-http-api if you don't want to use https://toncenter.com/:
```sh
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```
```sh
git clone https://github.com/toncenter/ton-http-api
```
```sh
cd ton-http-api/
```
```sh
mkdir private
```
```sh
curl -sL https://ton-blockchain.github.io/global.config.json > private/mainnet.json
```
```sh
./configure.py
```
4. Open .env and change the TON_API_HTTP_PORT port to any free port, for example 5885.

5. If you do not have docker-compose installed, you can do it with the command below:
```sh
curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.6.0/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

```sh
docker-compose build
```
```sh
docker-compose up -d
```
## Expanded Usage Instructions

1. **Editing the PHP Script:**
   - Locate the `php/index.php` file in your project directory.
   - Update the following configurations:
     a) Insert your API Key for the TON API service at https://toncenter.com/api/v2/jsonRPC. Alternatively, if you are using a custom ton-http API, modify the host details accordingly.
     b) Identify the section in the script where actions are defined. Uncomment the lines corresponding to the actions you want to perform (e.g., wallet creation, balance inquiry). Ensure you input the correct parameters in these lines for accurate functioning.

2. **Deploying the Script:**
   - Once the `php/index.php` file is configured, prepare to upload it to your server.
   - Transfer the entire "php" folder to a directory on your server that is accessible via the web. This ensures that the script can be executed through a web interface.

3. **Running the Script:**
   - After uploading, navigate to the location of the `index.php` file through your web browser.
   - Execute the script by accessing its URL. The script will interact with the TON Blockchain as per the configured actions and parameters.
